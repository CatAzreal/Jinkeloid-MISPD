# Music Implant SPD

Music Implant Shattered Pixel Dungeon(or MISPD) is a modification based on Shattered Pixel Dungeon, with aim to repurpose its established game mechanics and introduce a more replayable dungeon dwelling experience.

And music, they were the first feature I have ever established hence the name 'Music Implant'.

This mod existed back when Shattered is still in 0.4.x, and the current version is going to bring back and refine the ideas from the older version as complete as possible.
