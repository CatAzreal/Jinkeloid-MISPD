# Music Implant SPD

Music Implant Shattered Pixel Dungeon(or MISPD) is a modification project based on [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon/releases), with aim to repurpose its established game mechanics and introduce a more replayable dungeon dwelling experience.

Music Implant SPD is developed by TAGS DUEL, aka TentAcre™️ Games Studio Digital Unlimited©️ Entertainment®️ Ltd.
We are a humble team of two, but you can't stop us from choosing a name like this, nor can we resist such a brillant brand!

As for music, they were the first feature I have ever established hence the name 'Music Implant'.

This mod existed back when Shattered is still in 0.4.x, and the current version is going to bring back and refine the ideas from the older version as complete as possible.
